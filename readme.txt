This is a plugin that compares WooCommerce variations between products and allows you to copy them from one product to another.

Important Note:  This is a personal project for the purpose of practicing both plugin development and git collaboration.  Although the plugin is functional for the use described, I am not planning on developing it for commercial use.  However, it's pretty handy, so I thought it would be of use to other WooCommerce developers out there.  If you are interested in adapting this project for your own work, I'd love to hear from you... feel free to contact me at:
